Objective: The goal  of this project is to perform an image analysis prediction challenge.

Our best perfoming model is the VGG19_bn whose implementation can be found on the file vgg19_bn.ipynb.

Our code folder contains the following files: 


vgg19_bn.ipynb:
       A jupyter notebook file that contains the VGG19_bn implementation with PyTorch. 

vgg16.ipynb:
       A jupyter notebook file that contains the VGG16 implementation with PyTorch. 
       
vgg13_bn.ipynb:
       A jupyter notebook file that contains the VGG13_bn implementation with PyTorch. 
       
project3_VGG16_bn.ipynb:
       A jupyter notebook file that contains the VGG16_bn implementation with a a slightly different implementation 
       from the other vgg 16 file  using PyTorch. 
       
project3_ResNet101.ipynb:
         A jupyter notebook file that contains the ResNet101 implementation with PyTorch. 
         
Project3_VGG16.ipynb: 
       A jupyter notebook file that contains the VGG6 implementation with PyTorch. 
       
resnet_152.ipynb:
        A jupyter notebook file that contains the ResNet152 implementation with PyTorch.
